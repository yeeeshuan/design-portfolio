                    Math2Shine is an online learning platform that strives to teach students about the wonders of Vedic Maths. Working with the development team, 
                    I helped redesign and develop the Math2Shine website to reach out to more teachers, tutors, and students.

                I designed the brand to feel both fun and serious; we incorporated elements to make the website seem playful to appeal

                Part-playful, part-serious, just like how learning should be.

                As students develop their math skills, many of their hardships stem from a lack of confidence in their fundamental computing skills. 
                Through the redesign, I wanted to bring more attention to Vedic math to teach students skills and tricks to do 
                mathematics without second-guessing their answers.

                After sketching out a general user flow guide to guide students and tutors through the platform, I began to build high-fidelity

                To prepare for user testing, I began to prototype the navigation and content of the website. I explored with color, type, and layout, 
                imagining different scenarios that students and teachers may have when navigating the page. In addition, I also wanted to make sure that the website architecture from the previous website remained the same.

                The original design of the page posed many problems, as the page was bombarded with information, and important tools were difficult to access. 
                My team worked on pinpointing the pain points and brainstormed a variety of methods to effectively help students and teachers navigate through 
                the interface.

                Working on this internship heavily shaped my ability to design for multiple groups of people â€”
                I was forced to move past designing for one person and understand how to design a serious yet lighthearted platform for both teachers and students. 
                More user testing will allow the design of the website to continue to evolve and improve. 

                <br/>
                <br/>
                I was also able to gain many unique insights by collaborating and communicating with a team of developers â€” both as a designer and a member of the team. 
                Although I learned some of the basics of how to utilize the React.js to work the frontend, I still have much to learn about 
                all that the library offers.
