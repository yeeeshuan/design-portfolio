                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    From the Expo&rsquo;s mission of highlighting how a country saves lives, empowers lives, and connects lives, I chose to specifically focus on creating an experience that highlights the efforts China is putting into creating innovations that <strong>empower lives</strong>.

                    <p className = {styles.text}>
                    Something that I noticed when researching modern Chinese innovations is that a lot of them were linked to Chinese inventions thousands of years ago. The Great Green Wall, Belt and Road Initiative, and advancements in AI could be traced to Chinese inventions for irrigation, the Silk Road, and the abacus. 
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <p className = {styles.text}>
                    Thus, I wanted to concept of my exhibit to revolve around connecting the past with the present, allowing visitors to feel inspired by how Chinese inventions can continue to inspire the present.

                        I was able to find models and plans for what the pavilion would look like online. Something that I wanted to take advantage of from the models was the bamboo themeâ€”the architecture of the pavilion takes inspiration from the natural curves and forms that bamboo scrolls can create.

                        I modeled the journey through the pavilion using my concept map, imagining how I wanted one exhibit to flow to another. The experience would start with three exhibits about the Great Green Road/Irrigation, the Belt and Road Initiative/Silk Road, and AI/Abacus, laid out in chronological order with respect to the time they were invented, and then move to the ending experience.

                        For the first three educational exhibits, I wanted them to have a mix of different interactions for visitors to learn about the old and the new through the first three sets of inventions and innovations.

                    After seeing modern-day innovations from past inventions from the educational exhibits, I wanted to create an ending experience where visitors could understand the future possibilities of other Chinese inventions. This would allow visitors to leave the exhibit feeling inspired by how the Chinese can continue to innovate and empower lives.

                    <br/>
                    For this exhibit, I chose to fully build out and prototype the interaction.

                    <p className = {styles.text}>
                        I wanted the exhibit to feel like an extension of the pavilion. Taking inspiration from how the pavilion was designed with bamboo scrolls in mind, I created a bamboo wall that extended down the ending hallway. Each set of curves would be a station where visitors could learn more about a set of inventions and innovations, such as gunpowder to fireworks to spaceships.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Just like how the text would flow on ancient bamboo scrolls, characters would be etched on the walls for visitors to interact with.

                        For the ending experience, I designed both an <strong>individual</strong> and <strong>co-creative</strong> experience.

                    The Chinese characters that we see today are the result of thousands of years of evolution of each character, from complex forms to simple characters.
